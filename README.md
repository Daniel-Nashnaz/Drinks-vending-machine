# Process operating systems project
In my lab project I will show an example of a system that supports multiple threads (THREAD), which represents the connection between a server side and a client side. The program simulates the operations of a coffee machine, as soon as the drink is ordered, the server will receive a request from the customer and use the processes of preparing the drink, which are in a separate department and are structured in such a way that each drink and its preparation procedure will be in a separate process, a process that uses, for the purpose of explaining the operation of preparing the coffee, use synchronized to lock this operation and prevent a situation Deadlock, so that as soon as another customer wants to make coffee they will have to wait.
The server is always listening and will accept all the orders the client will send, and the client will receive all the orders he ordered in the order they were ordered until he asks to finish.
